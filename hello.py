In your README.md answer the following questions with True or False.

(5)==(5,) returns True False
Any of the following: (integer, string, list) can be the key of a dictionary. False
Any of the following: (integer, string, list) can be the value of a dictionary. True
Any of the following: (integer, string, list) can be in a set. True
s[0]="a" would result in an error if s is a string. True
If a = [(1,2),(3,4)] performing a[0]=3 would result in an error. False
If a key k is not in a dictionary d, then d[k] will return None. false
If ((x==y)!=(x is y)) is False, then x is an alias of y. False

 In your README.md answer the following questions:

What are logical errors and how are they different from syntax errors?

a. x <= 4 or (x != 9 and x > 10) false

b. x > 0 and x < 10 and x != 6 true

c. x == 1 or x > 0 True
